Kidkonnect
==========

Security child checkin system. Our goal is to provide the world with a free open source alternative to Excellerate, KidzPro, Connection Power, Fellowship, Arena, Parent Pager, and many other child check in systems. Keep in mind that kidkonnect is a web based check in system.

<b>Features:</b><br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;Picture based security System.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;Check out child with a bar code scanner.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;Junior and High School leaders can check in students with a smart phone. (no tag printed)<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;Being web based, Windows, MacOS and Linux computers can access the system.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;Being web based, Mobile phones running Windows, MacOS and Android can access the system.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;Visitor tags for families that are "church hopping".<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;Open Source means anything and everything can be modified.<br>

<b>Advanced admin options:</b><br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;To see child check in/out times for any date in the system.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;Manage Volunteers/Families/Children/Adults.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;Manage families and who can pickup kids. Valid parents that can pick up kids can be changed on the fly at the check in stations. (username and password required to change family information)<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;Most people have a mobile phone with unlimited text messages. So there is an option to send text messages to parents of children in trouble via a volunteers smart phone. (no texting charges for the church)<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;Add complete families at one time<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;Export parent email addresses of age groups in Windows format or MacOS format. i.e. Staff only wants to email one year old parents, the system can export only the parents email of the one year old class.<br>

<b>Requirements:</b><br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;ANY computer with a web browser and a Dymo printer can check in children/volunteers and print tags.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;Sunnybrook Christian Church (http://www.sunnybrookcc.org/) uses 3 Windows Vista Laptops and 3 DYMO LabelWriter 450 Turbo Thermal Label Printers.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;An Information Technology person to help setup hardware and web server.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;Server Computer. (most churches today have some kind of server, this can piggy back on it OR it can be a old computer dedicated to check in)<br>
